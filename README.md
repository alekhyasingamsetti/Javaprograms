| **Core Java**       | CLI, Data Types, Variables, Operators, Control Statements (if-else, loops) |
| **OOP Concepts**    | Classes, Objects, Constructors, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism |
| **Advanced OOP**    | Method Overloading, Method Overriding, Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default) |
| **Exception Handling** | Try-Catch, Finally, Throws, Custom Exceptions |
| **Collections**     | ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, String Collections |
| **Multithreading**  | Thread Class, Runnable Interface, Synchronization |
| **Java Libraries**  | String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, Arrays |
| **Logical Problems** | Palindrome Check, Largest Number, Grade Calculator |
| **Java 8 Features** | Lambda Expressions, Streams API |

## Java Projects and Tasks
Below are the tasks and projects undertaken for Java learning:

| **Task/Project Name**      | **Description**  |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| `Lab_OOPs_Inheritance`    | Practicing Inheritance and its types |
| `Lab_OOPs_Abstraction`    | Implementing Abstraction using Interfaces and Abstract Classes |
| `Real_example_abstraction_interface` | Real-world example of Abstraction and Interface usage |
| `Task19_Grade_calculator` | Java program to calculate grades based on marks |
| `ex_TernaryOperator`      | Finding the largest number using ternary operator |
| `ex_String_Collection`    | String manipulation and collection usage |

## API Testing Practice
Below are the API testing projects executed:

| **Project Name**                   | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `RestfullBooker.postman_collection.json` | API testing for a RESTful service (Booking System) |
| `SOAP-Project#1.postman_collection.json` | API testing for a SOAP-based service (Number Conversion) |

## API Testing Topics Covered
| **Category**  | **Topics** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Postman**  | CRUD Operations, API Testing, Collection Runner |
| **Data-Driven Testing** | Using CSV/JSON for test data in Postman |
| **Newman** | Running Postman Collections from CLI |
| **SOAP Testing** | Validating SOAP API Requests & Responses |
| **Automation** | Writing Tests in Postman for Assertions |

## Tools Used
- **Postman** – API testing and automation
- **Newman** – CLI runner for Postman collections
- **SOAP UI** – Web service testing
- **JMeter** – Performance and load testing
- **Java (Eclipse/IntelliJ)** – Programming and OOP concepts
- **TestNG** – Automation framework

## Conclusion
This repository showcases my journey in learning Java programming along with API testing projects to strengthen practical knowledge in automation and backend testing. Future learning will focus on integrating Java with Selenium for web automation.
